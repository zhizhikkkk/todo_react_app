You have 4 tasks to accomplish. After completing them publish your code to GitHub to your repository.

After publishing to GitHub, answer live-coding question with repository URL.

1. Try to add several tasks without closing modal window. Tasks will only appear once the windows is closed, fix this. = 2.5 points

2. Now, try to delete some tasks. Delete doesn't work properly. Fix it so that clicking the button will immediately delete task. = 2.5 points

3. There are two inputs in the "New task" modal window: "Title" and "Summary". = 7 points

   3.1 Add a new field "State" which will have 3 options: "Done", "Not done", "Doing right now".'
   It maybe a Button, Select, Checbox, etc. = 2 point

   3.2 Connect this field to Task object, so that every Task would have it's own "State". = 2 points

   3.3 Add a sorting buttons above Task list: "Show 'Done' first", "Show 'Doing' first", and "Show 'Not done' first". By clicking this buttons list should be sorted so that tasks with corresponding states will be shown first. = 2 points

   3.4 Add a filter buttons near sorting ones: "Show only 'Done'", "Show only 'Not done'", and "Show only 'Doing'". Same logic as 3.3, but now filter Task list. = 2 points

   3.5 Now, add the "Deadline" field, which will be a Date input. For instance, this Task is due to 25th of Decembet. Also, add related sorting buttons: "Sort by deadline"

4. To the left of "Delete" button (Trash bin icon) add "Edit" button. "Edit" should open "Edit task" modal window where user can edit all the fields of the Task. = 1 points.
